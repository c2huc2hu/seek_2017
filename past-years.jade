      | For SEEK 2016, we ramped up the difficulty by introducing three sub-tasks
      | to stop the Martian invasion. Our winners, "Wow I Thought", beat out the
      | runners up, Waterloo Something, our own invaders from UWaterloo. Thank you
      | to all of the sponsors, participants and volunteers!
