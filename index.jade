    | &nbsp;What is SEEK?

  p.text-left
    | SEEK is an annual competition hosted by Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX). Competitors are given a task,
    | some robotic components to design and build a robot that can complete a series of challenges. SEEK was first held
    | in 2015 as a way of getting more people interested and active in robotics. We'd have to say we've been pretty successful!

        | <strong> RSX (Robotics for Space Exploration) </strong>  was founded in 2013 to represent the University of Toronto
        | at the University Rover Challenge. Since then, we've added a couple more projects: Cansat, which develops
        | a rocket payload, and a High Altitude Balloon, that takes sensor readings of the atmosphere. As a
        | relatively new club, we pride ourselves on our openness to new members regardless of skill or experience.
        | If you're interested robotics and space, feel free to join us!
